word_frequencies.py - Has a method/function that reads in a text file and returns a list of the tokens in that file. (Independent of Capitalization). Has a method/function that counts the number of occurrences of each word in the token list and also has a method that prints out the word frequency counts onto the screen and the print out is ordered by decreasing frequency.

intersection_of_two_files.py - The program takes two text files as arguments and outputs the number of tokens they have in common.

reducing_two_word_frequency_counts.py - The program takes two word-frequency maps (given in two separate input text files) and creates an output word-frequency count file where the counts are added. The input and output files are of the form “word, count”, one of these per line. (Assumption - the input files are ordered alphabetically).
