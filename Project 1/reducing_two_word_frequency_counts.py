# CS 221 - Assignment 1 - Part C: Reducing two word-frequency counts
# FileName: 75003249_partC.py
#
# Student Name: Natarajan Chidhambharam
# Student No: 75003249
# 
# The program takes two word-frequency maps and creates an output word-frequency count file where the counts are added
#
# Execution: python 75003249_partC.py <Input-file 1> <Input-file 2>
